#   This script is used by McM when it performs automatic   #
#  validation in HTCondor or submits requests to computing  #
#                                                           #
#      !!! THIS FILE IS NOT MEANT TO BE RUN BY YOU !!!      #
# If you want to run validation script yourself you need to #
#     get a "Get test" script which can be retrieved by     #
#  clicking a button next to one you just clicked. It will  #
# say "Get test command" when you hover your mouse over it  #
#      If you try to run this, you will have a bad time     #

# Maximum validation duration: 28800s
